**World of Bits (WoB)** is a platform introduced by Shi et al. (2017) where AI agents learn to complete tasks on the web by performing low-level keyboard and mouse actions—the same interface humans use.

## Core Idea

WoB treats the web as an open-domain reinforcement learning environment. At each timestep, an agent receives:

- **Pixels** $\mathcal{I} \in \mathbb{R}^{W \times H \times 3}$ — rendered webpage screenshot
- **DOM** $\mathcal{D}$ — Document Object Model with element coordinates
- **Reward** $r$ — task completion signal

The agent outputs mouse coordinates $(x, y)$ and keyboard actions to interact with the webpage.

## Why the Web?

Three key benefits make the web an ideal learning platform:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Open-domain** | Unlimited websites provide diverse tasks and real-world semantics |
| **Open-source** | HTML/CSS/JS is inspectable and modifiable |
| **Data collection** | Human demonstrations can be crowdsourced easily |

Unlike robotics, web environments are fully digital—enabling fast iteration and massive scaling.

## Interactive Demo

## Benchmark Tasks

WoB introduces three task categories of increasing complexity:

### MiniWoB

100 hand-crafted web tasks with synthetic pages:

- **click-button** — click a specific button
- **enter-text** — type text into an input field
- **use-slider** — adjust a slider to a target value
- **book-flight** — complete a multi-step booking form

These tasks feature clean reward functions and controlled complexity.

### FormWoB

Real flight booking websites (United, Alaska, etc.) packaged as reproducible environments:

- Live HTTP traffic is cached via man-in-the-middle proxy
- Enables offline training while approximating real web dynamics
- Tests generalization to production websites

### QAWoB

Crowdsourced question-answering tasks on live websites:

$$
\text{Query} = \text{Template}(\text{slot}_1, \text{slot}_2, \ldots)
$$

Examples:
- *"What is the population of **Paris**?"* (Wikipedia)
- *"Find flights from **NYC** to **LA** on **Dec 25**"* (Flight sites)

Workers provide demonstrations of how to answer queries using keyboard and mouse.

## Agent Architecture

The baseline WoB agent uses a CNN-LSTM architecture:

```
Observation → CNN(pixels) + MLP(DOM text) → LSTM → Policy(actions)
```

Key design choices:
- **Multimodal input**: combines visual features with semantic DOM information
- **Recurrent memory**: LSTM tracks state across multiple interaction steps
- **Policy output**: coordinates $(x, y)$ for mouse, one-hot for keyboard

## Training Approaches

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Behavioral Cloning** | Supervised learning on human demonstrations |
| **REINFORCE** | Policy gradient with sparse task rewards |
| **Guided RL** | Warm-start with BC, then fine-tune with RL |

Behavioral cloning alone achieves reasonable performance but struggles with recovery from errors. RL enables adaptation but requires reward shaping for complex tasks.

## Performance Gap

Even with demonstrations and RL, significant gaps remain:

| Task Type | Agent Success | Human Success |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Simple clicks | ~80% | 100% |
| Multi-step forms | ~40% | 100% |
| Open-domain QA | ~20% | 100% |

This gap motivates continued research on web agents.

## Impact & Legacy

WoB pioneered the study of web-based agents and inspired subsequent benchmarks:

- **MiniWoB++** — extended tasks with improved reward signals
- **WebShop** — e-commerce navigation benchmark
- **WebArena** — realistic web task environment
- **Mind2Web** — large-scale web agent dataset

Modern LLM-based agents (GPT-4V, Gemini) are now evaluated on these benchmarks.

## Key Insight

By using the web as an environment, WoB bridges the gap between simulated benchmarks and real-world tasks—agents learn from the same rich, semantic content that humans create and interact with daily.
