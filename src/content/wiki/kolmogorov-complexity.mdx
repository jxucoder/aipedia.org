**Kolmogorov Complexity and Algorithmic Randomness** (by Shen, Uspensky, and Vereshchagin) is the definitive textbook on algorithmic information theory—the study of complexity, randomness, and information from a computational perspective.

## Core Definition

The **Kolmogorov complexity** $K(x)$ of a string $x$ is the length of the shortest program that outputs $x$:

$$
K(x) = \min \{|p| : U(p) = x\}
$$

where $U$ is a universal Turing machine and $|p|$ is the program length in bits.

## Key Properties

**Invariance Theorem**: Choice of universal machine only affects $K(x)$ by a constant:

$$
|K_U(x) - K_V(x)| \leq c_{UV}
$$

**Upper bound**: Every string has complexity at most its length:

$$
K(x) \leq |x| + O(1)
$$

**Incompressibility**: Most strings are incompressible:

$$
|\{x : |x| = n, K(x) < n - c\}| < 2^{n-c}
$$

## Algorithmic Randomness

A string is **algorithmically random** if it's incompressible:

$$
K(x) \geq |x| - O(1)
$$

Random strings have no exploitable patterns—they can't be compressed because any shorter description would be the pattern itself.

## Conditional Complexity

Given extra information $y$:

$$
K(x|y) = \min \{|p| : U(p, y) = x\}
$$

The mutual information between $x$ and $y$:

$$
I(x:y) = K(x) - K(x|y)
$$

## Uncomputability

**Fundamental result**: $K(x)$ is uncomputable.

No algorithm can determine the shortest program for every string. This connects to Gödel's incompleteness and the halting problem.

## Applications to AI

Kolmogorov complexity provides foundations for:

- **Minimum Description Length** (MDL): Model selection by compression
- **Solomonoff Induction**: Universal prior for prediction
- **AIXI**: Theoretical optimal agent framework
- **Occam's Razor**: Formalized as preferring low-$K$ hypotheses

## The Chain Rule

$$
K(x, y) = K(x) + K(y|x) + O(\log K(x, y))
$$

Joint complexity equals one string plus the other given the first.

## Sophistication vs Complexity

**Kolmogorov complexity**: Total information in a string  
**Sophistication**: Structure/pattern complexity (separating regularity from randomness)

A random string has high complexity but low sophistication—it's complex only because it's random, not because it has intricate structure.
