**CS231n** is Stanford's renowned course on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. It provides a comprehensive foundation in deep learning, from basic neural networks to state-of-the-art architectures.

## Course Philosophy

The course emphasizes:

1. **First principles understanding** — implementing backpropagation from scratch
2. **Mathematical foundations** — understanding why techniques work, not just how
3. **Practical experience** — hands-on assignments with real datasets

## Core Topics

### Image Classification Pipeline

The course starts with the fundamental task: mapping pixels to categories.

$$
f: \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C} \rightarrow \{1, 2, ..., K\}
$$

Students implement k-NN, linear classifiers, and loss functions before moving to neural networks.

### Backpropagation

The heart of deep learning—computing gradients through computational graphs:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial w}
$$

Implementing backprop from scratch builds intuition that frameworks abstract away.

### CNN Architectures

Progression through landmark architectures:
- **LeNet** → **AlexNet** → **VGG** → **GoogLeNet** → **ResNet**

Each architecture introduces key concepts: depth, skip connections, inception modules.

## Why It's on Ilya's List

This course provides the **foundational vocabulary** of modern AI:

- Understanding convolution, pooling, and feature hierarchies
- Intuition for optimization landscapes and training dynamics
- Context for why certain architectural choices matter

Many concepts introduced in CS231n (attention, residual connections, normalization) recur throughout modern AI systems, from vision to language models.
