**Dilated convolutions** (also called atrous convolutions) expand the receptive field exponentially without increasing the number of parameters or reducing spatial resolution. This paper introduced them for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation.

## The Problem

Standard convolutions face a tradeoff:
- **Pooling** increases receptive field but loses spatial resolution
- **Larger kernels** increase receptive field but add parameters quadratically

For dense prediction (assigning a label to every pixel), we need both large context and high resolution.

## Dilated Convolution

A dilated convolution with dilation factor $d$ samples input at intervals:

$$
(F *_d k)(p) = \sum_{s+dt=p} F(s) \cdot k(t)
$$

A 3×3 kernel with dilation $d$ has a receptive field of $(2d+1) \times (2d+1)$ while using only 9 parameters.

## Exponential Expansion

By stacking layers with dilations $1, 2, 4, 8, ...$, the receptive field grows exponentially:

| Layer | Dilation | Receptive Field |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1 | 3×3 |
| 2 | 2 | 7×7 |
| 3 | 4 | 15×15 |
| 4 | 8 | 31×31 |

After $L$ layers: $(2^{L+1} - 1) \times (2^{L+1} - 1)$ receptive field.

## Interactive Demo

## Context Module

The paper proposes a multi-scale context aggregation module:

$$
\text{Context}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{DilatedConv}_{d_i}(x)
$$

Multiple parallel dilated convolutions capture information at different scales, which are then combined for the final prediction.

## Key Properties

- **No resolution loss**: Unlike pooling, dilated convolutions maintain spatial dimensions
- **Parameter efficient**: Same number of weights as standard convolution
- **Flexible**: Dilation rate can be adjusted per layer or learned

## Applications

Dilated convolutions became foundational for:
- **Semantic segmentation** (DeepLab, PSPNet)
- **Audio generation** (WaveNet)
- **Time series** (TCN - Temporal Convolutional Networks)
