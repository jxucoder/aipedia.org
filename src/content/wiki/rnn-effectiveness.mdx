**The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks** is Andrej Karpathy's 2015 blog post that captivated the AI community by showing what simple RNNs could learn from raw text.

## The Core Idea

Train an RNN to predict the next character given all previous characters:

$$
P(x_{t+1} | x_1, x_2, ..., x_t)
$$

That's it. No parsing, no grammar rules, no structure—just characters. Yet the results are remarkable.

## Character-Level Language Model

At each timestep, the RNN:
1. Takes a character as input
2. Updates its hidden state: $h_t = \tanh(W_{hh}h_{t-1} + W_{xh}x_t)$
3. Outputs a probability distribution over all characters: $P(x_{t+1}) = \text{softmax}(W_{hy}h_t)$

During generation, sample from this distribution and feed it back as the next input.

## Interactive Demo

## What RNNs Learn

Karpathy trained char-RNNs on various datasets and found they learned:

**Shakespeare**
- Spelling, punctuation, line structure
- Character names, stage directions
- Iambic pentameter patterns

**Wikipedia**
- XML/HTML markup structure
- Balanced brackets and tags
- Link syntax

**Linux Source Code**
- C syntax (brackets, semicolons)
- Indentation conventions
- Function/variable naming patterns

**LaTeX**
- Mathematical notation
- Environment matching (begin/end)
- Citation formats

## Temperature Sampling

The **temperature** parameter controls randomness:

$$
P(x_i) = \frac{\exp(z_i / T)}{\sum_j \exp(z_j / T)}
$$

- **T → 0**: Greedy, picks highest probability (repetitive)
- **T = 1**: Standard sampling
- **T > 1**: More random, creative but potentially incoherent

## Hidden State Visualization

Karpathy discovered individual neurons tracking specific features:
- One neuron activates inside quotes
- Another tracks line length
- Some detect URLs or code comments

## Why This Matters

This post demonstrated that:
1. Simple models can capture complex structure
2. Raw prediction objective learns rich representations
3. Neural networks discover interpretable features

These insights presaged the success of GPT and modern language models.
