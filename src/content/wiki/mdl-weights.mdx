**Keeping Neural Networks Simple** by Hinton and van Camp introduced a principled approach to regularization: add noise to weights during training, effectively limiting the precision (and thus description length) of the learned parameters.

## The MDL Principle

The **Minimum Description Length** principle states that the best model minimizes:

$$
L(\text{model}) + L(\text{data} | \text{model})
$$

For neural networks:
$$
L(\text{weights}) + L(\text{errors} | \text{weights})
$$

## The Key Insight

Instead of precise weights, transmit *noisy* weights:

$$
\tilde{w} = w + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
$$

Higher noise $\sigma$ means:
- Fewer bits to describe weights (can use coarser precision)
- More bits to describe prediction errors

The network learns to find the optimal noise level.

## Mathematical Framework

Weight distribution after adding noise:

$$
q(w) = \mathcal{N}(w; \mu, \sigma^2)
$$

The description length (in bits) for communicating weights:

$$
L(w) \approx -\log \frac{q(w)}{p(w)}
$$

where $p(w)$ is a prior (often $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$).

## The Bits-Back Argument

A subtle insight: when transmitting weights with a known distribution, the receiver can "give back" some bits:

$$
\text{Effective bits} = H[q] - D_{KL}[q \| p]
$$

This is the same KL term that appears in VAEs!

## Connection to Modern Regularization

This 1993 paper anticipated:

| MDL Concept | Modern Equivalent |
|-------------|------------------|
| Noisy weights | Dropout, weight noise |
| Description length | KL divergence in VAEs |
| Bits-back coding | Variational inference |
| Optimal precision | Learned quantization |

## Training Procedure

1. Forward pass with noisy weights: $\tilde{w}_i = w_i + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_i^2)$
2. Compute expected loss: $\mathbb{E}_\epsilon[\mathcal{L}(x, y; w + \epsilon)]$
3. Update both $w$ and $\sigma$ via gradient descent
4. Network learns which weights need precision

## Why This Matters

This paper established:
- **Information-theoretic regularization**: Not just heuristics
- **Learned precision**: Different weights need different precision
- **Compression = generalization**: Simpler models generalize better
