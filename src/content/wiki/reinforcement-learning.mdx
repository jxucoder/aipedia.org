**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is the study of agents learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Unlike supervised learning, RL learns from rewards and consequences rather than labeled examples.

## The RL Framework

An agent interacts with an environment in discrete timesteps:

1. Agent observes state $s_t$
2. Agent takes action $a_t$
3. Environment returns reward $r_t$ and next state $s_{t+1}$
4. Repeat

The goal: learn a policy $\pi(a|s)$ that maximizes cumulative reward.

## Markov Decision Process (MDP)

RL problems are formalized as MDPs:

- **States** $\mathcal{S}$: Possible situations
- **Actions** $\mathcal{A}$: Available choices
- **Transition** $P(s'|s,a)$: Environment dynamics
- **Reward** $R(s,a,s')$: Feedback signal
- **Discount** $\gamma \in [0,1]$: Future reward weighting

## The Objective

Maximize expected discounted return:

$$
J(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t\right]
$$

where $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_0, s_1, a_1, r_1, \ldots)$ is a trajectory.

## Value Functions

**State value**: Expected return from state $s$ under policy $\pi$:

$$
V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t \mid s_0 = s\right]
$$

**Action value (Q-function)**: Expected return from taking action $a$ in state $s$:

$$
Q^\pi(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t \mid s_0 = s, a_0 = a\right]
$$

## Bellman Equations

Value functions satisfy recursive relationships:

$$
V^\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')]
$$

$$
Q^\pi(s,a) = \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + \gamma \sum_{a'} \pi(a'|s') Q^\pi(s',a')]
$$

## Two Approaches

**Value-based**: Learn $Q^*(s,a)$, act greedily
- Q-learning, DQN
- Works well for discrete actions

**Policy-based**: Learn $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ directly
- Policy gradient, PPO
- Handles continuous actions

## Key Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Key Idea |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Q-Learning | Value | Off-policy TD learning |
| DQN | Value | Neural network Q-function |
| REINFORCE | Policy | Monte Carlo policy gradient |
| A2C/A3C | Actor-Critic | Value baseline reduces variance |
| PPO | Policy | Clipped surrogate objective |
| SAC | Actor-Critic | Maximum entropy RL |

## Exploration vs Exploitation

A fundamental tradeoff:
- **Explore**: Try new actions to discover better strategies
- **Exploit**: Use current knowledge to maximize reward

Solutions: ε-greedy, UCB, entropy bonuses, curiosity-driven exploration.
